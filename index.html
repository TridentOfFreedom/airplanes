        An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.

        Orville and Wilbur Wright grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and developed an interest in aviation after learning of the glider flights of the German engineer Otto Lilienthal in the 1890s. Unlike their older brothers, Orville and Wilbur did not attend college, but they possessed extraordinary technical ability and a sophisticated approach to solving problems in mechanical design. They built printing presses and in 1892 opened a bicycle sales and repair shop. Soon, they were building their own bicycles, and this experience, combined with profits from their various businesses, allowed them to pursue actively their dream of building the world’s first airplane. At 10:35 a.m. on December 17, in front of five witnesses, the aircraft ran down a monorail track and into the air, staying aloft for 12 seconds and flying 120 feet. The modern aviation age was born. Three more tests were made that day, with Wilbur and Orville alternately flying the airplane. Wilbur flew the last flight, covering 852 feet in 59 seconds.

      An aircraft propeller, or airscrew, converts rotary motion from an engine or other power source, into a swirling slipstream which pushes the propeller forwards or backwards. It comprises a rotating power-driven hub, to which are attached two or more radial airfoil-section blades such that the whole assembly rotates about a longitudinal axis. Three types of aviation engines used to power propellers include reciprocating engines (or piston engines), gas turbines, and electric motors. The amount of thrust a propeller creates is determined, in part, by its disk area—the area through which the blades rotate.

      <p>The Concorde, a British-French turbojet, had a maximum speed of Mach 2.04, which is over twice the speed of sound. However, it’s heavily debated whether the Concorde or the TU-144, a Soviet supersonic airliner is faster. The TU-144 averaged Mach 1.6, but could fly up to Mach 2.29. The Concorde flew passengers from New York to London is a little over three hours, when it normally takes over seven hours. The TU-144 flew from Moscow to Alma-Ata, but both planes were retired due to fatal crashes and reliability issues. </p>

      <p>Flight attendants are not always paid for all the work they do. Oftentimes, they’re only paid flight time, or when the plane leaves the origin gate and arrives at the destination gate. This means flight attendants don’t get paid for assisting passengers before, during boarding, after flights, or for cleanup in between. Despite this, flights attendants receive extra benefits like flying for free, discounted airfare, paid hotels, etc. that some may feel make up for the excess time spent on the job. </p>
